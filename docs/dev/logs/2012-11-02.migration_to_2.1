create a new branch to ensure nothing breaks

    % git checkout -b 2.1_merge

fetch latest upstream changes (change origin if you use another
remote name for upstream cdist)

    % git fetch -v origin

Now try to merge upstream into the new branch.


    % git merge origin/2.1

fix any conflicts that may have been occurred due to local changes
and then **git add** and *git commit** those changes.

As the types have a new location, **cdist/conf/** now, you have to move
your own types there as well:

    % git mv conf/type/* cdist/conf/

The manifest location also changed, so move this one as well:

    % git mv conf/manifest/* cdist/conf/manifest/

Use **git status** to review the changes and ensure they
are in the git database:

    % git commit -m "Move types and manifests for 2.1 migration"

This should be everything necessary for a 2.1 migration. Test the result
by running cdist on one of your staging hosts:

    % ./bin/cdist config -v staging-host


You can now cleanup the empty conf/ directory:

    %  rmdir conf/* && rmdir conf
